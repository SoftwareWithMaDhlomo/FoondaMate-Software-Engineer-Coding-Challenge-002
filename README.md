Equation Solver
This application allows you to solve linear equations of the form ax + b = c.

This is a simple command-line tool that allows users to solve linear equations in the format "ax + b = c". It uses the sympy library to simplify and solve the equation.

To use the equation solver, run the equation_solver.py script:
python main.py

Testing
The unit tests for the format_equation function can be found in the test_format_equation.py file. To run the tests, run the following command:
python -m unittest test_format_equation.py
